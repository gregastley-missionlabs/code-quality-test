# code-quality-test

This is a simple compose app which "attempts" to solve the first problem of https://projecteuler.net/

It does give the correct answer for the example case, but unfortunately it does not find the answer to the problem posed in the text.

I encourage you to come up with a solution of your own, and then identify the issue in the implementation here. Furthermore, I would appreciate it if you could review this code, discussing any issues you find with respect to quality, correctness, performance, etc ...


# Note
Hopefully you will not encounter any issues running this app, but one of my colleagues did discover a stumbling block and the link to resolve this is at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66376361/an-exception-occurred-applying-plugin-request-id-com-android-application-wh/66391859#66391859
